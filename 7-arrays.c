/**
 * Arrays in C++ are basically the same in C. They hold just one data type. You can use the size function to know the number of elements in the array. This is an improvement from using the sizeof() / sizeof in C.
 *
 *
 * You can have character arrays, int arrays and so on. Declaration is the same.
