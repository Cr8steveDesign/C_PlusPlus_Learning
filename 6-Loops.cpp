int main(void)
{
	/*The basic structure of a loop has:
	1. An initialization
	2. A condition
	3. An update
	:: The above is mostly for the for ( ;  ;  )
	:: The while loop needs just a condition and an update or a break condition to prevent and infinite loop
	::::: There are also Range-based loops

	with C++ you can initialize inside the for loop
	You can initialize multiple variables in a for loop, separated with a comma; same thing with the conditions and/or update part.

	The second condition is treated as the termination operator, the earlier parts are evaluated and of non-effect - Comma operators.

	You can equally use the logical operators to chain two conditions together.

	With for loops, the update of the variable must be inside the for loop parenthesis, not the body

	Example of a Range Based Loop:
	int array1[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

	for (int n : array1)
	{
		cout << n << endl;
	}


	string c_string = "Hello and welcome to my world";

	for (char c : c_string)
		cout << c << endl;
*/

	return (0);
